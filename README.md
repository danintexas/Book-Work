Code from Java: From Control Structures through Data Structures

Going through the book both for college and on my free time. All code 
in this repository is from the above listed AWESOME book!

Please be aware I am self studying. So if anyone who happens on this 
sees any problems with my code please let me know. 

Thanks!

Daniel
